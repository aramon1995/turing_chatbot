      "  \"context\": \"5 Deployment\\nAn increasingly important goal of Transformers is\\nto make it easy to efﬁciently deploy model to pro-\\nduction. Different users have different production\\nneeds, and deployment often requires solving sig-\\nniﬁcantly different challenges than training. The\\nlibrary thereforce allows for several different strate-\\ngies for production deployment.\\nOne core propery of the libary is that models\\nare available both in PyTorch and TensorFlow, and\\nthere is interoperability between both frameworks.\\nA model trained in one of frameworks can be saved\\nthrough standard serialization and be reloaded from\\nthe saved ﬁles in the other framework seamlessly.\\nThis makes it particularly easy to switch from one\\nframework to the other one along the model life-\\ntime (training, serving, etc.).\\nEach framework has deployment recommenda-\\ntions. For example, in PyTorch, models are compat-\\nible with TorchScript, an intermediate representa-\\ntion of a PyTorch model that can then be run either\\n\\nmats such as JAX/XLA (Bradbury et al., 2018) and\\nTVM (Chen et al., 2018).\\nFinally, as Transformers become more widely\\nused in all NLP applications, it is increasingly im-\\nportant to deploy to edge devices such as phones\\nor home electronics. Models can use adapters to\\nconvert models to CoreML weights that are suit-\\nable to be embedded inside a iOS application, to\\nenable on-the-edge machine learning. Code is also\\nmade available3. Similar methods can be used for\\nAndroid devices.\\n6 Conclusion\\nAs Transformer and pretraining play larger roles in\\nNLP, it is important for these models to be acces-\\nsible to researchers and end-users. Transformers\\nis an open-source library and community designed\\nto facilitate users to access large-scale pretrained\\nmodels, to build and experiment on top of them,\\nand to deploy them in downstream tasks with state-\\nof-the-art performance.

Different users have different production\\nneeds, and deployment often requires solving sig-\\nniﬁcantly different challenges than training. The\\nlibrary thereforce allows for several different strate-\\ngies for production deployment.\\nOne core propery of the libary is that models\\nare available both in PyTorch and TensorFlow, and\\nthere is interoperability between both frameworks.\\nA model trained in one of frameworks can be saved\\nthrough standard serialization and be reloaded from\\nthe saved ﬁles in the other framework seamlessly.\\nThis makes it particularly easy to switch from one\\nframework to the other one along the model life-\\ntime (training, serving, etc.).\\nEach framework has deployment recommenda-\\ntions. For example, in PyTorch, models are compat-\\nible with TorchScript, an intermediate representa-\\ntion of a PyTorch model that can then be run either\\n\\nmats such as JAX/XLA (Bradbury et al., 2018) and\\nTVM (Chen et al., 2018).\\nFinally, as Transformers become more widely\\nused in all NLP applications, it is increasingly im-\\nportant to deploy to edge devices such as phones\\nor home electronics. Models can use adapters to\\nconvert models to CoreML weights that are suit-\\nable to be embedded inside a iOS application, to\\nenable on-the-edge machine learning. Code is also\\nmade available3.

These models may still require customizing through finetuning before they can be deployed into production environments. Hosted models typically come with their own accompanying libraries and resources like datasets, scripts, and tutorials. They offer significant advantages over unmodified pretrained models because they allow developers to quickly get started with a particular task while providing greater flexibility and control over the final output.
